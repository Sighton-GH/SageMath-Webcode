# F1TENTH gym environment ROS2 communication bridge
This is a containerized ROS communication bridge for the F1TENTH gym environment that turns it into a simulation in ROS2.

# Installation

**Supported Systems:**

- Ubuntu native (tested on 22.04, and 24.04) with ROS 2.
- Windows 10/11, macOS, and Ubuntu with an NVIDIA gpu and nvidia-docker2 support.
- Windows 10/11, macOS, and Ubuntu without an NVIDIA gpu (using noVNC).

This installation guide will be split into instruction for installing the ROS 2 package natively, and for systems with or without an NVIDIA gpu in Docker containers.

## Native on Ubuntu 22.04 (Recommended)
Setup a native Ubuntu 22.04 either on your own machine (using dual boot or main OS) or using a virtual machine with your favorite virtualization software ([VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion) recommended).

### Step-by-step install (fresh workspace)
1. **Install ROS 2 Humble.** Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).
2. **Create the workspace and a venv inside it:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p $HOME/sim_ws/src
   python3 -m venv --system-site-packages $HOME/sim_ws/.venv
   source $HOME/sim_ws/.venv/bin/activate
   python3 -m pip install -U pip
   ```
3. **Clone `f1tenth_gym_ros` into the workspace (dev-humble):**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/sim_ws/src
   git clone -b dev-humble https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym_ros.git
   ```
4. **Clone `f1tenth_gym` inside `f1tenth_gym_ros` (dev-humble):**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/sim_ws/src/f1tenth_gym_ros
   git clone -b dev-humble https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym.git
   ```
   If the `f1tenth_gym` directory already exists (some clones include it), skip the clone.
5. **Install `f1tenth_gym` (follow its README):**
   - With the venv already active, the minimal pip install is:
     ```bash
     cd $HOME/sim_ws/src/f1tenth_gym_ros/f1tenth_gym
     pip install -e .
     ```
6. **Install ROS dependencies and build the workspace:**
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   cd $HOME/sim_ws
   rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y
   colcon build
   ```

Once you're done and everything is installed, skip to the [Launching the Simulation](#launching-the-simulation) section below.
## Docker ##
(Alternative install, skip if you have already used the native install above)

### With an NVIDIA gpu:
**Install the following dependencies:**

- **Docker** Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) to install Docker. A short tutorial can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) if you're not familiar with Docker. If you followed the post-installation steps you won't have to prepend your docker and docker-compose commands with sudo.
- **nvidia-docker2**, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) if you have a support GPU. It is also possible to use Intel integrated graphics to forward the display, see details instructions from the Rocker repo. If you are on windows with an NVIDIA GPU, you'll have to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Please refer to the guide [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl), [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html), and [here](https://dilililabs.com/zh/blog/2021/01/26/deploying-docker-with-gpu-support-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux/).
- **rocker** [https://github.com/osrf/rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker). This is a tool developed by OSRF to run Docker images with local support injected. We use it for GUI forwarding. If you're on Windows, WSL should also support this.

**Installing the simulation:**

1. Clone this repo
2. Build the docker image by:
```bash
$ cd f1tenth_gym_ros
$ docker build -t f1tenth_gym_ros -f Dockerfile .
```
3. To run the containerized environment, start a docker container by running the following. (example showned here with nvidia-docker support). By running this, the current directory that you're in (should be `f1tenth_gym_ros`) is mounted in the container at `/sim_ws/src/f1tenth_gym_ros`. Which means that the changes you make in the repo on the host system will also reflect in the container.
```bash
$ rocker --nvidia --x11 --volume .:/sim_ws/src/f1tenth_gym_ros -- f1tenth_gym_ros
```

### Without an NVIDIA gpu:

**Install the following dependencies:**

If your system does not support nvidia-docker2, noVNC will have to be used to forward the display.
- Again you'll need **Docker**. Follow the instruction from above.
- Additionally you'll need **docker-compose**. Follow the instruction [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install docker-compose.

**Installing the simulation:**

1. Clone this repo 
2. Bringup the novnc container and the sim container with docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
``` 
3. In a separate terminal, run the following, and you'll have the a bash session in the simulation container. `tmux` is available for convenience.
```bash
docker exec -it f1tenth_gym_ros-sim-1 /bin/bash
```
4. In your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/vnc.html](http://localhost:8080/vnc.html), you should see the noVNC logo with the connect button. Click the connect button to connect to the session.

# Launching the Simulation

1. `tmux` is included in the contianer, so you can create multiple bash sessions in the same terminal.
2. To launch the simulation, make sure you source the venv, the ROS2 setup script, and the local workspace setup script. Run the following in the bash session from the container:
```bash
source $HOME/sim_ws/.venv/bin/activate
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/local_setup.bash
ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py
```
A browser window should pop up redirecting you to [https://app.foxglove.dev](https://app.foxglove.dev). You will then need to connect to click on `Open Connection`, then chose `Foxglove Websocket` and paste in the websocket's address printed in the terminal in blue i.e `[INFO] [launch.user]: Foxglove WebSocket: ws://localhost:8765`. If you can see the topics on the left, then the connection is complete. To visualize the simulation, you will need to change layout by importing the layout file `gym_bridge_foxglove.json` in the launch folder of this package. Foxglove is the recommended setup, but if you prefer RViz (old Gym setup), you can also use rviz to visualize the sim, with `gym_bridge.rviz` available in the launch folder of this package too.

You can then run another node by creating another bash session in `tmux` or a separate terminal.

# Configuring the simulation
- The configuration file for the simulation is at `f1tenth_gym_ros/config/sim.yaml`.
- Topic names and namespaces can be configured but is recommended to leave uncahnged.
- The map can be changed via the `map_path` parameter. It can be a package-relative path like `maps/levine` or a built-in gym track name like `Spielberg`. The map follows the ROS convention; the image file and the `yaml` file should live together.
- The `num_agent` parameter can be changed to either 1 or 2 for single or two agent racing. Multi-agent racing (>2) is planned, but not yet supported by the gym_ros.
- The ego and opponent starting pose can also be changed via parameters, these are in the global map coordinate frame.

The entire directory of the repo is mounted to a workspace `/sim_ws/src` as a package. All changes made in the repo on the host system will also reflect in the container. After changing the configuration, run `colcon build` again in the container workspace to make sure the changes are reflected.

# Topics published by the simulation

In **single** agent:

`/scan`: The ego agent's laser scan

`/ego_racecar/odom`: The ego agent's odometry

`/map`: The map of the environment

A `tf` tree is also maintained.

In **two** agents:

In addition to the topics available in the single agent scenario, these topics are also available:

`/opp_scan`: The opponent agent's laser scan

`/ego_racecar/opp_odom`: The opponent agent's odometry for the ego agent's planner

`/opp_racecar/odom`: The opponent agents' odometry

`/opp_racecar/opp_odom`: The ego agent's odometry for the opponent agent's planner

# Topics subscribed by the simulation

In **single** agent:

`/drive`: The ego agent's drive command via `AckermannDriveStamped` messages

`/initalpose`: This is the topic for resetting the ego's pose via RViz's Foxglove's 2D Pose Estimate tool.

In **two** agents:

In addition to all topics in the single agent scenario, these topics are also available:

`/opp_drive`: The opponent agent's drive command via `AckermannDriveStamped` messages. Note that you'll need to publish to **both** the ego's drive topic and the opponent's drive topic for the cars to move when using 2 agents.

`/goal_pose`: This is the topic for resetting the opponent agent's pose via RViz's or Foxglove's 2D Goal Pose tool.

# Keyboard Teleop

The keyboard teleop node from `teleop_twist_keyboard` is also installed as part of the simulation's dependency. To enable keyboard teleop, set `kb_teleop` to `True` in `sim.yaml`. After launching the simulation, in another terminal, with ROS sourced, run:
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```
Then, press `i` to move forward, `u` and `o` to move forward and turn, `,` to move backwards, `m` and `.` to move backwards and turn, and `k` to stop in the terminal window running the teleop node.

# Developing and creating your own agent in ROS 2

There are multiple ways to launch your own agent to control the vehicles.

- The first one is creating a new package for your agent in the `/sim_ws` workspace inside the sim container. After launch the simulation, launch the agent node in another bash session while the sim is running.
- The second one is to create a new ROS 2 container for you agent node. Then create your own package and nodes inside. Launch the sim container and the agent container both. With default networking configurations for `docker`, the behavior is to put The two containers on the same network, and they should be able to discover and talk to each other on different topics. If you're using noVNC, create a new service in `docker-compose.yml` for your agent node. You'll also have to put your container on the same network as the sim and novnc containers.


## FAQ & Debugging
### I have Python < 3.9
The current `f1tenth_gym` requires Python 3.9+. Use Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble or update your Python environment to 3.9+.

### This package is managed externally, PEP 668
You are trying to install the package using the system python. This is outdated and not recommended as per PEP 668. Please ensure you install `f1tenth_gym` inside a virtual environment as instructed with `.venv` above.

### Pyqt6 6.10 cached, fails to install
In rare cases, you might have a newer cached version of pyqt6 which breaks the .toml install. To resolve this, first install pyqt6 first using ```pip3 install pyqt6==6.7.1``` and then install the f1tenth_gym using ```pip3 install -e .```.

### Gym install hangs on PyQt6>6.7.1 installation
This has been documented happening on VMWare Fusion for Mac. This stems from using a server image of Ubuntu 22.04. Specifically, this happens because PyQt6 prompts you to accept its GPL license which you can not see/accept from a standard pip install. Please resort to installing PyQt6 6.7.1 with license as that is the maximum supported version for the Ubuntu 22.04 Arm Server Image. To resolve this, first install pyqt6 first using ```pip3 install pyqt6==6.7.1 --config-settings --config-license= --verbose``` and then install the f1tenth_gym using ```pip3 install -e .```.

### AttributeError: module 'coverage' has no attribute 'types'
This is due to an outdated coverage package. To resolve this, run ```pip3 install --upgrade coverage```. The minimum coverage version required is 7.6.1.

### ImportError: cannot import name 'Transpose' from 'PIL.Image'
This is due to an outdated pillow version. To resolve this, run ```pip3 install --upgrade pillow```. The minimum pillow version required is 9.1.0.

### ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility
This is due to an outdated scipy version. To resolve this, run ```pip3 install --upgrade scipy```. The minimum scipy version required is 1.13.0.

### "opencv>=3. invalid" error on pip install
This indicates that you have outdated pip, wheel or setuptools. To resolve this, you can run ```python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools```. This will upgrade all tools used by python when pip installing packages.
